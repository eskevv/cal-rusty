Command Line w/ Rust :)
[A Scientific and Programmer Calculator]

*What it does:*
1. choose between scientific and programmer mode
2. enter a string of math operations into the command line
3. w/Debug enabled: watch the operations be calculated in order of precedence
4. fancy output with colors and loading
5. file input for multiple calculations

*Flexibility:*
1. operations must be in correct mathematical format obviously
2. any amount of white space allowed
3. supports negative numbers side by side with subtraction (multiple negations possible)
4. multiple un-needed paranthesis (such as (((4+1))))
5. re-enter calculations and quit when you want
